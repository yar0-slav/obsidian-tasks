/**
 * A helper class to construct group names for data types that do not naturally sort in alphabetical order.

 * sort from {@link Priority.P1} to {@link Priority.P4}, instead of alphabetically.
 *
 * This class provides a way to store a {@link name} and a {@link sortOrder}, from which {@link groupText}
 * can be constructed.
 *
 * For an example of use, see {@link TasksDate.category}.
